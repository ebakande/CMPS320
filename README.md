My website name is sitckylaverne the overview of the website is a website to inform users on stocks. The reason why I decided to choose this subject is that I love stocks and the stock market has been very iffy right now.
I implemented a wrapper, nav, footer, footing, and padding as well which I learned from my first HTML class.
My website is hosted using AWS.
To run the website just use the this link provided byb aws which is access to my aws bucket sitckylaverne. https://sitckylaverne.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Internet+Apps+Development/index.html
