<h2>Stocks</h2>

<p>
Stocks represent ownership in a company, giving shareholders a claim on part of the company’s assets and earnings. When you buy a stock, you're essentially purchasing a small piece of that company. Stocks are bought and sold on exchanges and are a fundamental component of most investment portfolios. Their value can rise or fall based on the company’s performance, market trends, and economic factors. Investing in stocks can be a powerful way to build wealth over time, but it’s important to research and understand the risks involved before diving in.
